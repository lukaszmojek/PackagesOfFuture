# PackagesOfFuture

Ok, so basically this app was created only in order to pass a couple of subjects on studies and that is it.
<br>
You can find basic CQRS here, but without second database for reads though, as it was needed to finish it ASAP, otherwise no passing of the current semester, and yeah, you probably know how it goes.
<br>
<br>
The theme was to create an application, that would handle business of package delivery company, thus the name `PackagesOfFuture`.

Requirements:
<ul>
  <li>.NET 5.0+ SDK</li>
  <li>Rider 2021.2 or Visual Studio 2019 v16.8.3+</li>
  <li>Own database</li>
  <li>Some computer more powerful than a potato</li>
  <li>And some operating system on top of it</li>
</ul>
