# PackagesOfFuture

### For the README's for the concrete project please use links below:
- [PackagesOfFuture.WebUI](./PackagesOfFuture.WebUI/)
- [PackagesOfFuture.Backend](./PackagesOfFuture.Backend/)

## Requirements for running it locally:
- .NET 5.0.x SDK
- IDE, I recommend latest version of Rider, but Visual Studio should also do the trick for Backend
- [VS Code for Frontend](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [EF Core tools installed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet)
- [Azure Data Studio installed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15)
- Some computer more powerful than a potato
- And some operating system on top of it I guess

## Setting up environment:
Go to the `docker` folder and execute the command `docker compose up`
